                                        Project Break The Cycle is excited to announce our relaunch today! We’ve 
                                        been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to establish organizational 
                                        sustainability and clarify our mission, making it easier and more efficient 
                                        to support the causes we all care about. Below, we will address key points 
                                        about our organization, and some awesome changes that were made!
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                        At Project Break The Cycle, we aspire to break the cycle of injustice by empowering 
                                        proven, transparent, and relevant nonprofit organizations through creative 
                                        fundraising mechanisms. In other words, we’re a nonprofit for nonprofits, helping 
                                        them fundraise in ways they haven’t done before by tapping into unexplored revenue 
                                        streams. We’ve established a community wanting to support transparent nonprofits 
                                        while in return receiving amazing products to display their support. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text causes__text2">
                                        Every few months, we partner with a different non-profit organization and select 
                                        a campaign we want to support. Afterwards, we do the leg work when it comes to 
                                        creatively fundraising. Currently, Project Break The Cycle’s main fundraising 
                                        streams are external merchandise sales and internal corporate matching programs. 
                                        Over the duration of an active campaign, all donations and 100% of profits go 
                                        towards that specific campaign. After a campaign concludes, donations are still 
                                        accepted for it, although 100% of profits from merchandise sales will go to the 
                                        now active campaign. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                        To address supply chain inefficiencies within our merchandise sales model, Project 
                                        Break The Cycle will shift to a made-to-order model, working with suppliers and 
                                        manufacturers based in the United States. Once a supporter purchases a piece of merchandise, 
                                        they should expect to receive their order in 1-3 weeks, as every item is made to order - 
                                        but we promise, it’ll be worth it! 
                                    </p>
                                    <p className="causes__text">
                                        We’re also excited to launch an Artists for PBTC program, where local artists can submit 
                                        their designs for near-future merchandise! In exchange for their support to Project 
                                        Break The Cycle’s mission, they will be receiving social media spotlight, press 
                                        releases, credit on every piece of merchandise produced, free merchandise, and much 
                                        more! Be on the lookout for more details about this program soon!

                                        Project Break The Cycle is also organizing an Ambassador Program for individuals interested 
                                        in promoting our merchandise. In exchange for their unique marketing and promotional skills 
                                        being used for good, we’ll send them free merchandise so they can show their audience how 
                                        amazing the different pieces are! More details to come in a separate update.
